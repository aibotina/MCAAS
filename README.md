1.project description: This project is the experimental verification source code for the paper "Predicting influenza antigenicity by matrix completion with antigen and antiserum similarity" 
                       by "Peng Wang, Wen Zhu, Bo Liao, Lijun Cai, LihongPeng and Jialiang Yang". It is written in MATLAB. The project is mainly to achieve matrix completion of HI table 
					   by fusion of virus and antigen sequence.
2.run: Minimum 4G memory required, we have run on win10 and linux systems, MATLAB 2014a and above. In this project, you can run the main file directly to start the running of the project.
